==========
This is the home page for Astronomia.  Astronomia is a small Python library for
calculating the ephemeris of the Sun, Moon, and planets.  It also has some
utilities for working with time and angles.

Astronomia will work with Python 2.6+ and 3.0+.

History

Astronomia is a fork of the Astrolabe library created by Bill McClain.  The
Astrolabe library is no longer available.

I focused on the Python code, updating with newer data and equations as I found them.
