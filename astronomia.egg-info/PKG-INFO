Description: 
        Introduction
        ============
        Astrolabe is a collection of subroutines and
        applications for calculating the positions of the sun, moon,
        planets and other celestial objects. The emphasis is on high
        accuracy over a several thousand year time span. Note that
        the techniques used are overkill for most calendar
        applications. 
        
        The subroutine library attempts to implement some
        the techniques described in <cite>Astronomical
        Algorithms</cite>, second edition 1998, by Jean Meeus, <a
        href="http://www.willbell.com/">Willmann-Bell, Inc</a>. 
        
        Currently there are no graphical applications apart from
        some demo CGI interfaces. 
        
        Astronomia will work with Python 2.6+ and 3.0+.
        
        Documentation
        =============
        Reference documentation is at http://pythonhosted.org/astronomia/
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        At the command line::
        
            $ pip install astronomia
            # OR
            $ easy_install astronomia
        
        Or, if you have virtualenvwrapper installed::
        
            $ mkvirtualenv astronomia
            $ pip install astronomia
        
        Development
        ===========
        Development is managed on bitbucket at
        https://bitbucket.org/timcera/astronomia/overview.
        
        History
        =======
        Astronomia is a fork of the Astrolabe library created by Bill McClain.  The
        Astrolabe library is no longer available.
        
        I focused on the Python code, updating with newer data and equations as I found them.
        
        
        Changes
        =======
        
        v0.2.3-1, 2013-08-31:
        
            * Minor changes to get the README.rst to post to the PyPI page.
        
        v0.2.3, 2013-08-31:
        
            * Made fday_to_hms more robust by getting rid of the integer part
              of the Julian date.
            * Replaced is_dst with a different (better?) algorithm that at a
              minimum has updated DST definitions.
            * Fixed ell_to_geo and added tests.
            * Reworked the fday_to_hms algorithm to be more robust.
            * Previous it would return 59 seconds instead of a full minute.
            * Added fday_to_hms tests.
        
        v0.2.2:
        
            * Added new tests and expanded test coverage based on tox coverage report.
            * Minor PEP8 edits from flake8
            * Changed the delta T table to make more readable.
            * Verified equations against NASA Eclipse web site.
            * Added the ability for cal_to_jd to work with fractional years and months.
            * Moved all sin/cos/tan... to the numpy equivalents
            * flake8 style suggestions
            * Now have an even better tox.ini - coverage, flake8
            * Removed unused imports
            * Added the html report generation from coverage.
            * Improved the docs
            * Added support for tox and coverage
            * Made documentation match recent moves.
        
        v0.2.1:
        
            * Moved coordinate functions from util to calendar
            * Added ecl_to_geo
            * Minor cleanups
        
        v0.2: 
        
            * Refactored nut_in_lon -> nutation_in_longitude
            * Refactored nut_in_obl -> nutation_in_obliquity
            * Renamed elp2000.py -> lunar.py
            * Refactored ELP2000 class to Lunar class
            * Renamed vsop87d.py -> planets.py
            * Refactored VSOP87D class to Planets class
            * Added mean_elongation, mean_anomaly, argument_of_latitude Lunar
              functions
            * Shifted many functions to work with numpy
              arrays along with scalars
            * Added several tests
            * moon.Moon.dimension3 no longer repeats logic, but calls other functions
        
        v0.1, 2013-06-19:
        
            * Initial release.
            * Fork from Astrolabe
            * Python 2 and 3 compatibility
            * Added tests
            * Several minor bug fixes
            * Moved to git for source code control
            * Moved to bitbucket
